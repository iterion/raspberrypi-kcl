# Raspberry PI modeled in KCL

This is just me playing around with KCL to an extent, but the goal is to fairly accurately model various versions of Raspberry PI in KCL.

So far, this repo only contains the 3B+, since that's one that I own and can verify. I also own a Pi Zero W, so that will probably be next.
